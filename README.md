# RemoteClipboard

Remote Clipboard for share your clipboard with everyone on the network.

I am a Junior C# Developer at a University. With this project I want to develop myself, so if you see something strange or you know a better solution for some line of code, let me know and I will correct it.

## Features-Beta

- You can share your clipboard with anyone on the network
- As you received a notification about the clipboard, you see who sent it, also you can copy it to the clipboard, or instantly paste it
  to the focus window
- <s>You can send it to a specified user</s>
- ...(It will be more)

## Features-v1.0 (Work-in-progress)(Not pushed)
- Every client will be indentified on the network with their username and IP address(and will be stored in a list), and you can send specific message to.
- Switched to sending message by sending it to specific IP address. (Now the message sent by broadcasting)

## Under construction

**I try to develop all-day-long, as my time let it. If you have some idea, what feathers should it have, let me know in a *PM* or in the *issue* tab with *idea* label.**
